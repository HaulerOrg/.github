# Hauler

## Our Story

Hauler was created to provide a platform to connect the local farmer, artisan, street vendor to the end customer using modern technology so that the customer can go back to buying the vintage way of touching, feeling and negotiating with the vendor before buying while also helping the vendor to earn more by reaching out to more customers
